Final Project      
This VR game contains two different games. The first is the CapCatch game, the second is the Dart game.

In CapCatch, the player manages the goalkeeper. Opposite him is a turret that throws a ball. He/she has to catch the balls from the turret and throw them into the basket. He/she earns 1 point with each ball thrown into the basket and wins the game when he/she reaches 10 points. If he cannot catch the ball from the turret and the turret scores a goal, he/she loses 1 point. If it has -10 points, the player loses the game. 

In the Dart game, the player throws the dart sticks at the dart board. According to the numbers he/she hits, the player earns points in the dart game rules. When the score reaches a certain number, the player wins the game. Every 5 shots it moves away from the board. He/she has 15 throws. If he/she does not reach the desired score in all 15 shots, the player loses the game.
